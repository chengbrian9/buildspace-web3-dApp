# Waves On-Chain 

Waves On-chain is a web3 dApp deployed on Ethereum that allows you to send/view messages on a decentralized platform. Users will also receive rewards at random! You can find the live contract on Rinkeby testnet explorer at https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x434751C0121DAACE59761c99d6F5d9b561dDb795. 

User Journey:
1. Click 'Connect Wallet' and connect your Metamask wallet (select Rinkeby testnet).
2. Leave a message to go with your wave! 
3. Click 'Wave' and approve/send the transaction.
4. After your transaction confirms, your wave should now show on the dApp! You may need to refresh the page. Alternatively, your wave will be live on chain - you can check the contract address on Etherscan for your transaction!
